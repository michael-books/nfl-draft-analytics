    "## 7. Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Round 1 dominance is real, but not absolute.** First-round picks produce All-Pros at ~3–5× the rate of later rounds, but even Round 1 has only a ~15–25% hit rate. Most first-rounders never earn All-Pro honors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Round 1/2 cliff is sharp.** There is a dramatic drop in All-Pro probability between the last pick of Round 1 and the first pick of Round 2 — more than between any two consecutive picks within Round 1 itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Position matters.** QB and elite pass-rusher positions (DT, DE) produce the highest All-Pro rates. This reflects both positional value and the fact that all-world QBs/rushers dominate voting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Late-round value exists.** Certain positions show meaningful All-Pro rates even in rounds 3–5. Identifying these positions is where smart drafting can create competitive advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Rounds 6–7 are speculative.** The All-Pro hit rate in rounds 6–7 is near zero across almost all positions. These picks are best viewed as roster depth and special-teams contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample size:** 12 draft classes × ~256 picks = ~3,000 players. Position-round cells can be small.\n",
    "- **First-Team All-Pro only:** We use only First-Team selections, the highest bar. Including Second-Team would raise hit rates but muddy the \"elite\" definition.\n",
    "- **Name matching:** Normalized string matching may miss players with unusual name variants. A manual override dictionary could improve edge cases.\n",
    "- **Selection bias:** Our cohort (2010–2021) coincides with the start of the analytics era. Drafting strategies have evolved.\n",
    "- **Position changes:** We use position-at-draft-time. Players who switched positions (e.g., OT → TE) are tracked under their draft position.\n",
    "- **Undrafted free agents excluded:** UDFA All-Pros are not counted in hit rates (they have no draft round), which slightly overstates undrafted success relative to drafted players."
